# User_Safety_Monitor
mobile computing project of group 26

Our project consists of creating an android application which enable a care taker(guardian) to get the health information on the fly and be able to check on the User(grandpa)
This enables the care taker to take necessary action and keep tabs on the user so that their health is always at the best condition.

Clone the repo from the git branch sreevatsava_macharla present at 
https://github.com/sreevatsava01/User_Safety_Monitor/tree/sreevatsava_macharla

or unzip the code submitted in to a folder

Android studio should be able to pick the the folder as an app

Install the required dependencies such as gradle etc if needed ideally there android studio will install them for you.

Build the project, hit run and launch the app in emulator.

You will be presented initally with a login screen, Use the credentials as shown below.

UserName :- grandpa
Password :- 100YrsOld

UserName :- guardian
Password :- angel

use the grandpa credentials to login to the user profile and vice versa for the guardian profile

The flow diagram presented in the report should give you  an overall idea of what the UI does

The below are the steps on how you would add a polygon for geo fence
1) head to geofencing screen using "create Geo fencing" button in the guardian profile
2) touch "add markers" button to start adding markers
3) touch on the map to "add markers"
3.1) "remove marker" removes the latest added marker. If there are 4 markers on the map you need to hit the button 4 times to hit the marker.
4) click "add area" when you are satified with how to markers look to show the added polygon

Swiping back in general takes you back to the previous screen.
